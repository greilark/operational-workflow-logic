# Enterprise Case Lifecycle & Escalation Framework
### Documented via Lucidchart

## 📌 Project Overview: "Always Be Hustling"
[cite_start]This repository contains the architectural blueprint for an enterprise-level support lifecycle, originally established on **October 5, 2023**[cite: 6]. It standardizes how a technical case moves from submission to closure.

## 📋 Logical Workflow Features
* [cite_start]**Severity Triage**: Conditional logic to separate P1 emergency cases from P2–P4 standard tickets[cite: 12, 13].
* [cite_start]**Escalation Triggers**: Defined paths for notifying Technical Account Managers (TAMs) and putting cases back in the queue if they fall outside standard hours[cite: 1, 16, 20].
* [cite_start]**Milestone Tracking**: Integrated checkpoints to verify data, troubleshoot, and set up tech lead tickets if unresolved after 1 hour[cite: 22, 25, 26].
* [cite_start]**Operational Perfection**: Clear decision nodes for business hours, team standups, and response cadences[cite: 16, 28, 29, 33].

## ⚙️ The Impact
This framework serves as a visual "source of truth," reducing the learning curve for new technicians and ensuring consistent outcomes through structured system logic. [cite_start]It ensures that tickets are only closed after a customer response is received and a follow-up email is sent[cite: 43, 46].
